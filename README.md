When it comes to apply styles to your app, there are many options out there. In this post I explore some of them and analyse some advantages / disadvantages of each one. At the end of the road, the decisions always dependent on your project and requirements, but I aim to offer a general characterisation of the options, without of course covering all of them, since every week / month new libraries or techniques could come into the play.

In one of my [blog article](http://www.barbararodeker.com/ladyandtech/?p=154) I explore the following options:

1. XIBs + UI properties
2. Configuration: name it plist, name it JSON
3. Using UIAppearance
4. Pixate
5.  NUI
6. Nimbus
7. InterfaCSS
8. Protocols

This repository contains the 4 projects used as examples:

1. Styling plain
2. Styling with UIAppearance
3. Styling with Protocols
4. Styling with CSS
